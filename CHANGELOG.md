## [0.0.4] - Automatic contract/validator compatibility matrix

### Added

- **`tools/verify_contract_matrix.py`** (new) - a real, automatic compatibility matrix between the published v1 JSON Schema files and this SDK's own Python reference validator. It discovers every real `*.schema.json` under `contracts/json-schema/v1/`, cross-checks that each one has a matching `validate()` entry (and vice versa - a stale validator entry with no real schema file is flagged too), runs every conformance fixture through `validate()` and confirms it's judged the way its own `.valid.json`/`.invalid.json` filename claims, and proves the two negative cases this matrix specifically guards: an unknown contract name and an incompatible `schema_version`.
- **`ProjectManifest` contract validation** (`validation.py`) - the matrix immediately found a real, concrete gap it was built to catch: `project-manifest.schema.json` (the `hydra-umc.project.json` contract every repository in this ecosystem publishes) had no corresponding entry in the Python validator at all - it could never actually be validated. Added the real required-field/enum/pattern checks mirroring the schema (`ecosystem`, `name` pattern, semver `version`, `role`/`deployment_target`/`maturity` enums, non-empty unique `technologies`, nullable `parent`, `native_version`'s string-or-component `pattern`), plus real conformance fixtures (`project-manifest.valid.json`/`.invalid.json`).
- 22 new tests (`test_validation.py`) = 30 total.

### Fixed

- `tools/build_test.py`'s non-mutating `build-test.sh` check compiled Python sources but never actually ran the real conformance test suite (`clients/python/tests`) or the new contract matrix - both are now wired in, so the "test" step genuinely tests something.

### Changed

- Automated build version increment from 0.0.3.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Public, dependency-free Python v0 external-machine bridge contract:
  `BridgeJob`, bridge/machine/cell state enums and `evaluate_job()` safety
  gate. It is the shared high-level boundary for the ROS 2, OpenPnP, 3D
  printer, CNC and laser integrations; it does not expose motion control.
- `docs/BRIDGE_CONTRACT.md` and five focused unit tests proving productive
  work is rejected when either side is not ready while `ABORT` remains
  requestable through the authorised safety path.

### Fixed

- UpdateManifest validation now requires an HTTPS artifact URL with a real
  hostname, rejecting malformed strings such as `https:///artifact.deb`.

- The dependency-free Python validator now rejects invalid RFC 3339
  `timestamp_utc` values and JSON booleans supplied where the `EventEnvelope`
  sequence or `ServerDiscovery` numeric counters require integers. Python
  treats `bool` as an `int` subclass, which previously let invalid contract
  payloads pass reference validation.

## Documentation

### Added

- `docs/PYTHON_CLIENT.md` - full reference for the `validate()` function
  and `hydra-umc-contract-validate` CLI in `clients/python`: the exact
  required-fields and extra-validation-rule table for all 6 contracts
  (`DeviceDescriptor`, `HealthReport`, `SafetyState`, `UpdateManifest`,
  `EventEnvelope`, `ServerDiscovery`), previously only readable from
  `validation.py`'s own source. Verified live against the real function
  and CLI. Linked from `docs/CONTRACTS.md`. Documentation-only - no code
  changed, no version bump.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Automated build version increment from 0.0.2.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-26

  `UpdateManifest`.
- Dependency-free Python reference validator and command-line entry point.
- Valid and invalid conformance fixtures plus four host-side validation tests.
- Runnable Python example for `HealthReport` validation.

### Limits

- Protobuf, OpenAPI, package publication, and non-Python clients are not part
  of this initial contract release.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Initial SDK documentation, multilingual README files, and target layout.
- Contract, API, conformance, and adapter-boundary specifications.
